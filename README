# LogWiseML

LogWiseML is a project that collects and analyzes logs from applications using machine learning algorithms. It generates easily readable analysis reports and identifies errors and deficiencies, including programming and security issues. LogWiseML goes beyond a traditional SIEM system and helps users identify core problems in applications by finding patterns and structure in unstructured logs. The project is designed for scalability and expansion to handle logs from different frameworks and programming languages. This README provides insight into the project's architecture, implementation, and future potential. The goal is to improve application development and maintenance through effective troubleshooting and analysis.

## Problem Statement

How can machine learning be used to analyze logs from an application and identify errors and deficiencies? How can a system help provide an overview and identify core problems in an application by finding structure and patterns in unstructured logs? How can the project be expanded and scaled to handle logs from multiple frameworks and programming languages? How can we best ensure its security against attacks and ensure that the collected data complies with GDPR regulations?

## Further Development

- Users can create training models indirectly through the system.
- Datasets can be shared in processed form.
- The idea is to enable users to share their own data and indirectly access others' data.
- Autogenerated machine learning models or custom models can be used.
- Docker extension: Since LogWiseML is so closely integrated with Docker, adding a Docker extension is a logical step.

## Getting Started

To get started with LogWiseML, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.7 or later
- Docker (optional for the Docker extension)

```

3. (Optional) If you're using the Docker extension, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t logwiseml .
```

### Usage

1. Run the LogWiseML application:

```bash
python logwiseml.py
```

2. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary inputs for log analysis.

3. View the generated analysis reports in the designated output folder.
